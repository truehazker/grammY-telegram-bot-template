This is a template for a [GrammY](https://grammy.dev) bot. It is a good starting point for your own bot.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository
2. Create .env file from provided .env.example and fill it with your bot token and other variables
3. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
4. Run `yarn dev` to start the bot in development mode
5. Run `yarn build` to build the bot for production
6. Run `yarn start` to start the bot in production mode

## Features

- Scalable architecture
- TypeScript support
- Configurable with environment variables
- Built-in logging

## Environment variables

| Variable    | Description                                             | Default | Required |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|:--------:|
| BOT_API_KEY | Telegram bot token                                      |         |    âœ“     |
| ADMIN_IDS   | Comma-separated list of Telegram user IDs of bot admins |         |          |
| LOG_LEVEL   | Log level                                               | info    |          |

## Custom environment variables

To add your own environment variables, you need to:

1. Add them to the `.env` file
2. Add them to the [config.service.ts](src/services/common/config.service.ts) file in a way similar to the existing
   variables

Then you can use them in your code using the `ConfigService` instance:

```typescript
import { Config } from '../services/common/config.service';

Config.myCustomVariable;
```

> **Note:** The better way of getting environment variables is to use the bot's context:
> ```typescript
> ctx.config.myCustomVariable;
> ```
> But this is only possible in the bot's handlers and middlewares.

## Logging

The bot uses [pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) for logging. It is configured to log to the console by default.
You can change this behavior by editing the [logger.service.ts](src/services/common/logger.service.ts) file.
